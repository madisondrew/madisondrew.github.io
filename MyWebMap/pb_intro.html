      <h2><center>Chaco Canyon</center></h2>


      <p1><center> Chaco Canyon is a large archaeological site in NW New Mexico that is classified as a UNESCO Worked Heritage Site. It was occupied from about 
        900 - 1180 CE by the Ancestral Pueblo people. During this time, Chaco became a cultural, ritual, and possibly political hub for the surrounding region. 
        The multiple pueblos that make up the larger site are well-known for the unique assemblages that were excavated
        in the first half of twentieth century. These include various types of ceramic vessels, exotic items imported from Mesoamerica, 
        and the largest quantity of turquoise jewelry that has ever been excavated in the Southwest archaeological region.

      <h3><center>Pueblo Bonito</center></h3>
      <p3>Pueblo Bonito is the largest structure in Chaco Canyon, and was likely the epicenter of ritual and political activity. 
        It has been estimated that the pueblo was made up of over 800 rooms and was 4 stories tall at the peak of the Chacoan sytem. It was also home to 35 kivas, or semi-subterranean ceemonial structures. 
        Some of these act as evidence for large-scale ceremonies due to their size and estimated capacity. The artifacts from the canyon were concentrated at Pueblo Bonito, with unusual quantities of ritual 
        paraphernalia, ceramics, ornaments, and other objets. 
        It was also the home to multiple burials of hypothesized elite individuals, which may be the reasoning behind the large amount of prestige goods that were placed in the 
        structure.
