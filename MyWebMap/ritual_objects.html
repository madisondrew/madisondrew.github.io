<h2><center>Ritual Objects in Archaeology</center></h2>

<p1><center> The term "ritual objects", also "ritual paraphernalia", refers to items and materials that innately hold an ideological power to
    their associated cultural group and/or were used in ceremonial practice. These items are typically tied exclusively to 
    spiritual parctice, but they can also be items that are multi-modal, or function in more than one context. 
    For instance, a ceramic vessel can be used for both the general serving of food, in which it is classified as a domestic 
    object, or it can be used to consume foods or beverages that are exclusive to ritual leaders in ceremonial settings.
    In this case, the vessel would be considered an object of ritual or spiritual status. 
    <br></br>

    In archaeological practice, ritual objects are typically identified based on the context in which they are found upon excavation. 
    These contexts include ceremonial structures or spaces, structured deposits, and oftentimes burials. If objects were placed in these spaces, especially if they are 
    found in these contexts repeatedly, archaeologists are able to define their past function as tools in ideological practice. 
    Ritual objects can also be identified by their unique appearance and features, such as markings, that do not appear on objects 
    found in more domestic settings. Ritual objects tend to be quite distinctive in the archaeological record, however they can 
    be a bit tricky to identify if they are multi-modal items.

<h3><center>Ritual Objects at Chaco Canyon</center></h3>

<p2><center> Chaco Canyon, particularly Pueblo Bonito, is known for the large amount of unique ritual paraphernalia excavated at the site. 
    These objects are both exclusively used in ritual practice, as well as multi-modal. The ritual paraphernalia here includes items such as shell trumptets, 
    inlaid effigies, specialized ceramics, and various wooden objects. Items that functioned in both ceremonial and domestic contexts have been identified as 
    jewelry pieces, faunal remains, ground stone, and more general ceramic forms. These objects have been excavated from kivas, burial crypts, ritual storage rooms, 
    and other spaces in Pueblo Bonito, which leads archaeologists to believe that it was a ceremonially important structure.
