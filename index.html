        <h2> <center> Biography </center></h2>
             <p1> <center>
                Madison Drew is currently a doctoral student at <a href= "https://anthropology.unm.edu/people/grad-students/profile/madison-drew.html" style="color:darkolivegreen" > the University of New Mexico</a>, where she studies Southwestern archaeology. 
                Her research interests include ornamentation, personal adornment, the representation of personal adornment in iconography, 
                ritual paraphernalia, ritual practice, and the connection between the material and cosmological worlds.
                <br></br>
                In the spring of 2023 she completed her Masters project, titled "An Analysis of Mimbres Ornaments from the Maxwell Museum of Anthropology".
                This study consisted of the recording of information regarding the Maxwell Museumâ€™s collection of Mimbres ornaments, which represents 46 Mimbres sites.
                The jewelry pieces were categorized based on the raw material they are made from, the ornament form they represent, and their presence in burials.
                This project allowed for the author to identify patterns within the collection that were able to provide information regarding the stylistic and material preferences in Mimbres adornment during the Late Pithouse and Classic Periods (~ 550 - 1130 CE).
                <br></br>
                Madison's previous education includes a Master of Arts Degree in Archaeology from the University of New Mexico, awarded in May of 2023, and
                 a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Anthropology with a Minor in History from the University of Arizona, awarded in May of 2020.
