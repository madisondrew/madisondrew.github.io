              Madison currently resides in Albuquerque, New Mexico with her partner and her cat Pinkie!
              She enjoys spending time with her family, watching cringey reality television, and ordering takeout food on a Friday night with her partner.
    
              Madison is also an avid collector of vinyl records. She has a large collection of vintage and modern records from her favorite classic and current artists. Having grown up with music lovers, Madison has inherited many vintage albums. 
              From the Beatles to Taylor Swift, she always enjoys putting on an album she working on her dissertation research!

              In the future, Madison looks forward to visiting her partner's family in Italy, exploring more of New Mexico's archaeological sites, and expanding her family with more cats.
